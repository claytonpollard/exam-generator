Fermat's little theorem states that if $p$ is a prime number, then for any positive integer (whole number) $a$, the number $a^p-a$ is a multiple of $p$.

For example: $2^7-2=126$, which is a multiple of 7 as $126\div7=18$.

From the theorem, it can also be said that if $a$ is not divisible by $p$, then $a^{p-1}\div p$ will result in a remainder of 1.
